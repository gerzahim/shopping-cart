              <strong>Q: Does Herb'n Kulture offer free shipping?</strong><br /><br />A: Our Sales Reps are not allowed to offer any customers free shipping. Customers are responsible<br />for all shipping charges regardless of the size of the order. Ask your Sales Rep for more details about<br />shipping costs&mdash;our standard shipping method is UPS Ground unless otherwise requested and pre-<br />arranged. We may offer limited free shipping promotions, so if you see or hear about a free shipping<br />promotion make sure to take advantage immediately as it is not commonly offered.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: What is MAP and why is it necessary?</strong><br /><br />A: Some of the products we carry require our customers to resell at a MAP (Minimum Advertised<br />Price) which is set and required by the manufacturer. We do not set these prices, but are contractually<br />obligated to ensure that our customers maintain MAPs with certain products in order for us to carry<br />these products. We will do our best to inform you of the applicable products and the corresponding<br />MAP with each when you place your order. Violation of MAP requirements may result in termination of<br />your account Herb'n Kulture.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: Do I need a special tobacco license to sell your Buck Naked Whole Leaf Tobacco?</strong><br /><br />A: No. When tobacco is in its whole leaf form it is currently considered to be an agricultural product,<br />therefore tobacco taxes are not applicable at this time.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: Is it legal to sell all of your products in my city/state/country and are there restrictions?</strong>br /><br />A: All of our customers are responsible for doing researching local laws to determine which of our<br />products are legal to sell and if there are restrictions in your locale. Please do not ask our Sales Reps<br />what is legal to sell in your area as they are not familiar with the different laws in each city/state/<br />country and will be unable to provide you with accurate, up-to-date information.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: Why do you need my Tax ID#?</strong><br /><br />A: We require you to submit your Tax ID# and applicable forms before ordering with our company<br />because as a wholesaler we are required to insure that we are only selling to customers with valid, legal<br />resell capabilities.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: How do I sign up for the website and/or start an account with Herb'n Kulture ?</strong><br /><br />A: On the website: Click the &ldquo;Log In&rdquo; link in the upper right hand corner of our website and you will have<br />the option to sign up if you are a new customer, or log in if you have used our website in the past. If<br />you do not remember your password, click the link for &ldquo;Forgot Your Password&rdquo; and it will be emailed to<br />you immediately. If you would rather start an account over the phone, simply call in with your Tax ID#<br />handy and one of our sales reps will be happy to assist you so that you can place orders via phone and<br />fax. Please be aware that just because you have started an account over the phone does not mean you<br />will be able to access our website; the only way to view and order products online is by visiting the Sign<br />Up page and creating your own unique website account.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: Do you drop ship?</strong><br /><br />A: No, we do not offer drop shipping at this time and have no plans in the foreseeable future to do so.<br /><br />

              <strong>Q: Why do you need my Sales Tax and bank account information for a credit application?</strong><br /><br />A:  We require your<br />bank account information to further validate that you are currently in business by calling to make sure<br />the bank account is valid.</p>
